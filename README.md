Rory O’Kane’s .emacs.d
========

My [Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) configuration folder.

I’m just getting started with Emacs, so don’t use this as an example for yourself yet. Suggestions for improving my config are welcome.

See also my [.vim directory](https://github.com/roryokane/dotvim).
